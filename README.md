# EnterAct Video

Enteract Video is a collaborative video conferencing platform with real-time code editing and enhanced meeting features, built using React and Stream SDK.

## 🚀 Features

- **Video Conferencing**: Seamless video calls powered by Stream SDK, allowing users to communicate efficiently.
- **Strict Mode**: The host can enforce a full-screen mode to ensure participants stay engaged. If a participant exits the meet window or switches tabs for more than 30 seconds, they are automatically removed.
- **Dynamic Attendance**: The host can take attendance at any time. A pop-up appears on participants' screens at random positions, requiring them to confirm their presence within 30 seconds.
- **Collaborative Code Editor**: A real-time code editor integrated into meetings, enabling participants to write and edit code together seamlessly.
- **User-Friendly UI**: A clean and intuitive interface designed for a smooth user experience.
- **Multi-Device Support**: Works well across different devices, but optimized for desktop usage.
